 * build-tokens.js
 * ============================================================================
 * Mirrors ap_ds_storybook's build-tokens.js pattern (per-flavor build +
 * a combined, selector-scoped bundle for runtime on/off switching), but
 * extended to TWO independent toggleable dimensions instead of one:
 *
 *   THEMES:    core / green / gold        -> [data-theme="..."]
 *   VIEWPORTS: mobile / tablet / desktop  -> [data-viewport="..."]
 *
 * ap_ds_storybook doesn't have a viewport dimension -- that's new here.
 * Viewport is treated exactly like a theme: its own standalone build per
 * option, plus a combined bundle scoped by a data attribute so it can be
 * turned on/off at runtime the same way [data-theme] works.
 *
 * PIPELINE NOTE: this reads tokens.json directly and does NOT run
 * `npx token-transformer`. token-transformer's own output format was found
 * to double-wrap every $type/$value into `{ value, type }` objects (a bug
 * in token-transformer itself, confirmed absent from the raw tokens.json),
 * which broke every resolved value in the CSS/JS output. Style Dictionary's
 * own `source` array already does the set-merging token-transformer was
 * used for, without that corruption -- see the project doc's
 * "Debugging findings" section for the full story.
 *
 * THEME x VIEWPORT CROSS-PRODUCT (see project doc for more):
 * tier_1_green/tier_1_gold each carry their OWN complete copy of
 * fontSize/lineHeights' `desktop`/`tablet`/`mobile` sub-scales (e.g.
 * green's desktop heading scale is 1.5, core's is 1.25, gold's is 1.4) --
 * "theme" and "viewport" are NOT independent axes at the data level. Each
 * theme's top-level `font1.headingScale` (etc.) is just an alias to
 * `{fontSize.desktop.font1.headingScale}` by default; the viewport_mobile/
 * tablet/desktop sets each redirect that SAME alias to that theme's own
 * `mobile`/`tablet`/`desktop` sub-scale instead. So layering a theme's set
 * THEN a viewport's set (in that order -- see COMBINATIONS below) resolves
 * the alias against that theme's own re-defined breakpoint scale, not
 * core's -- e.g. green + mobile correctly resolves to green's mobile
 * headingScale (1.25), giving h1 = 16 x 1.25^4 ~= 39, distinct from both
 * green's own desktop value (81) and core's mobile value (28).
 *
 * An earlier version of this script built THEMES and VIEWPORTS as two
 * fully independent single-axis bundles (all-themes.css / all-viewports
 * .css), each defaulting the OTHER axis to a fixed value (themes always
 * built against core's viewport defaults; viewports always built against
 * core's theme) -- meaning a page with both a non-core theme AND a
 * non-desktop viewport active would silently show the wrong numbers,
 * because neither bundle ever combined the two. COMBINATIONS below fixes
 * this by building the full 3x3 cross-product directly, each block scoped
 * by a COMPOUND selector (`[data-theme="..."][data-viewport="..."]`) so
 * every one of the 9 theme/viewport pairs gets its own real, correct
 * values with no ambiguity or cascade-order dependence between blocks --
 * each compound selector only matches its own exact (theme, viewport)
 * attribute pair, so unlike two `:root`-scoped rules layered from
 * different files, there's nothing for two rules to collide over.
 *
 * TIER 2 SEMANTIC TYPOGRAPHY -- COMPANION CUSTOM PROPERTIES:
 * Every `tier_2_typography` composite token (Display/Headline/Title/
 * Label/Body/Meta) collapses to a single CSS `font` shorthand custom
 * property via @tokens-studio/sd-transforms' `typography/css/shorthand`
 * transform (part of the `tokens-studio` transformGroup) -- e.g.
 * `--ap-tier-2-typography-body-lg: 300 18px/28px 'TWK Lausanne';`. That
 * shorthand can only ever express font-style/variant/weight/stretch/
 * size/line-height/family -- letterSpacing, textCase, and textDecoration
 * are STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE to fold into the CSS `font` shorthand (a
 * spec limitation, not a tooling gap -- see the project doc's "Composite
 * typography styles" section for the full pros/cons comparison against
 * ap_ds_storybook's SCSS-mixin approach, which sets each property as its
 * own declaration and therefore doesn't have this limitation).
 *
 * Rather than switch to mixins, each `build()` call below runs a SECOND,
 * separate Style Dictionary pass over the exact same source files and
 * selector, using every `tokens-studio` transform EXCEPT
 * `typography/css/shorthand` -- so each composite token's resolved value
 * stays the full {fontFamily, fontWeight, lineHeight, fontSize,
 * letterSpacing, textCase, textDecoration} object for one extra format
 * (`css/typography-companion`, registered below) to pull just those
 * three otherwise-lost properties out as their own companion custom
 * properties (`--<token>-letter-spacing`, `-text-transform`,
 * `-text-decoration`), appended into the SAME destination file right
 * after the shorthand vars. Consumers use both together, e.g.:
 *   font: var(--ap-tier-2-typography-body-lg);
 *   letter-spacing: var(--ap-tier-2-typography-body-lg-letter-spacing);
 *   text-transform: var(--ap-tier-2-typography-body-lg-text-transform);
 *   text-decoration: var(--ap-tier-2-typography-body-lg-text-decoration);
 * This keeps the one-liner shorthand for the properties it CAN express
 * (still far more compact than a mixin per style) while completing the
 * composite definition for the three it can't.
 *
 * LINE HEIGHT UNIT FIX:
 * @tokens-studio/sd-transforms' `ts/size/lineheight` transform treats
 * lineHeight tokens as a CSS-native unitless ratio (e.g. `1.5`, meaning
 * "1.5x the font size") and deliberately leaves plain numbers unitless --
 * correct for THAT convention, but this project's `lineHeights.*` tokens
 * are actually absolute pixel leading values computed by the same
 * base*scale^n formula as fontSize (e.g. 46, meaning 46px, not "46x the
 * font size"). Left as-is, that reads as a wildly wrong line-height
 * everywhere it's used raw -- including inside the Tier 2 composite
 * `font` shorthand above, e.g. `18px/28` is CSS for "18px text, 28x
 * line-height" (~504px of leading) rather than the intended 28px.
 * `ap/lineheight/px` (registered below) is a custom value transform,
 * inserted immediately after `ts/size/lineheight` in the transform list,
 * that appends "px" to any already-resolved bare-number lineHeight value
 * -- for both standalone `lineHeights.*` tokens (their own `$type`
 * resolves to the singular "lineHeight" by the time transforms run, not
 * the plural "lineHeights" tokens.json uses -- the tokens-studio
 * preprocessor normalizes DTCG type names) and for the `lineHeight`
 * sub-field of `typography`-composite tokens (Tier 1's font1/font2/font3
 * heading composites and Tier 2's semantic composites alike), fixing the
 * shorthand's embedded value too. Needs an explicit `transforms` array
 * (built from the `tokens-studio` group's own list, see MAIN_TRANSFORMS
 * below) rather than `transformGroup: "tokens-studio"` plus an appended
 * extra, since inserting a transform in the MIDDLE of the group's order
 * -- after size resolution, before the shorthand composer packs
 * everything into one string -- isn't possible by appending alone.
