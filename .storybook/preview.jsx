/**
 * ap_ui_kit has TWO independent toggleable dimensions (ap_ds_storybook only
 * has one, Theme) -- see build-tokens.js. build/all-combinations/css/
 * variables.css has one block per (theme, viewport) pair -- 9 total --
 * each scoped by a COMPOUND selector (`[data-theme="green"][data-viewport
 * ="mobile"]`, etc.), so an element matches exactly one block whenever
 * BOTH attributes are present on it. Every token in the project (color,
 * border, typography, everything) lives inside one of these 9 blocks now
 * -- there's no more single-axis `[data-theme="green"]`-only or
 * `[data-viewport="mobile"]`-only fallback -- so `data-viewport` must
 * always be present wherever `data-theme` is, or NOTHING resolves there.
 *
 * NOTE: Theme's toolbar dropdown is deliberately NOT exposed -- its
 * Green/Gold options are redundant with the dedicated "Tier 1 - Green"/
 * "Tier 1 - Gold"/"Tier 2 - Green"/"Tier 2 - Gold" sidebar pages (each pins
 * its own `globals: {theme}` on the story object, which works with or
 * without a toolbar UI for it).
 *
 * There is deliberately NO toolbar/global for viewport at all. An earlier
 * version of this file exposed one (as a `deviceScale` global, named to
 * avoid colliding with Storybook's own reserved "viewport" global/addon --
 * see git history if that collision needs revisiting for something else
 * later). It was removed because a Storybook-wide toolbar control is the
 * wrong shape for this: viewport only ever affects Font Size and Line
 * Height -- Color, Border, Letter Spacing, Font Weight, and Font Family
 * never read a viewport-scoped token -- so a global toggle would show up
 * doing nothing on every other page in the project. Font Size and Line
 * Height now carry their OWN local Mobile/Tablet/Desktop toggle instead
 * (see ViewportPreviewPanel.jsx), scoped to exactly the two pages where it
 * matters. `data-viewport` below is fixed at "desktop" -- every OTHER
 * token type resolves identically no matter which viewport is active (the
 * viewport sets only ever redirect fontSize/lineHeights' headingScale/
 * bodyTextScale aliases), so "desktop" here is just a stable default for
 * everything outside those two pages; ViewportPreviewPanel overrides it
 * locally for its own subtree via a nested TokenPreviewContext.Provider,
 * independent of this fixed value.
